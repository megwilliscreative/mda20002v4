  Movement Australia prophetically declares that Australian cities belong to God.

  Movement Australia champions a new paradigm where the local Church and local Christian leaders make a choice to come together in humility, trust and reconciled diversity to become a generational, city-wide family.

  The focus of this city-wide family is to serve one another, accept responsibility for the stubborn facts affecting their city and engage collaboratively to bring solutions that permeate their city with a generous, localised gospel that releases beauty and shalom.

  The impact of this new paradigm is showcased at Movement Day. Click on an upcoming Movement Day event below:
