:content: "Through a unified church that proclaims the good news of the gospel, much
  can be done to see the transformational life of the gospel and the expansion of
  the Kingdom of God come to our communities and places. \n\nYou will hear stories
  from around the world, from various denominational, social, generational and ethnic
  leaders, so that more city gospel movement champions can be raised up to impact
  their places. \n\nThere will also be discussions on the key issues and themes that
  surround gospel movements and how everyone can get involved. \n\nWe invite you to
  join the conversation. \n\nThis podcast is brought to you by Movement Day Australia.
