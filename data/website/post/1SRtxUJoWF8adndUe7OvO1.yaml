:content: "# The Next Step\n\n__A MOVEMENT DAY ROUND TABLE__ is about accelerating
  the effectiveness of the GOSPEL in your city/town.\n\nA GOSPEL MOVEMENT in a town
  or city is evidenced by:\n\n1. Christianity is growing faster than the general population.\n\n2.
  Progress in the meeting of the social needs (Healing the pain);\n\n3. Christians
  in places of cultural influence.\n\n__A GOSPEL MOVEMENT is ideally:__\n\n*The whole
  church*\n\n*with the whole gospel*\n\n*for the whole city/town.*\n\n__Develop a
  CORE LEADERSHIP GROUP__\n\nStart where you are with who you have. \n\nDevelop a
  small leadership team with interested pastors, market place leaders, NFP leaders
  and key interested people, if possible representing gender, ethnic, age and vocational
  diversity.\n\n__Plan a MOVEMENT DAY ROUND TABLE__\n\nPlan a short (around 2 hours),
  simple, program.\n\n  1. Begin by casting a simple biblical vision of Jesus coming
  with good       news (word and deed)for the community.\n\n  2. Celebrate current
  gospel initiatives (short stories).\n\n  3. Know your city/town with a hand out
  Fact Sheet of statistics             including stats on pain points e.g. crime,
  domestic violence, foster         children, etc. \n\n  4. Have the mayor and/or
  a business leader give a short talk on             their vision/love for the community.\n\n
  \ 5. Conclude with a discussion on developing focused strategies to           further
  the existing Gospel initiatives and then discuss what new           initiatives
  need to be developed for the city/town, especially in the \t\t\tmeeting of needs.\n\n
  \ 6. The core leadership team meet to process, plan momentum and release       people
  into the city.\n\n  Suggestion: Place several short testimonies throughout the program
  from     people who have experience with current issues of pain in the community.\n\n
  \ __Some factors to consider:__\n\n\t1. Relational unity reflecting diversity.\n\n\t2.
  Love for the community.\n\n\t3. Prayer and biblical vision.\n\n\t4. Research to
  understand the city and its needs.\n\n\t5. Civic engagement. Partnerships with government,
  NFPâ€™s etc.\n\n\t6. Focused strategies.\n\n\t7. Clear leadership group\n\n\t8. Releasing
  people into gospel initiatives.\n\nThe MOVEMENT team can assist you.\n\nEmail: ians@oneheart.com.au\n"
