:short_biography: Peter Sondergeld is the senior pastor of The Project Church, which
  he was instrumental in planting in 2011. He served as a director of Biblical Counselling
  Australia from 2013 to early 2018 when he stepped down to focus on Restore Ministries.
  He is a registered teacher, counsellor and counselling supervisor. He gets excited
  at the thought that God might work through him to grow people up to be more thoughtful,
  strong and passionate. Peter and his wife Angela have four sons. When Pete isn’t
  preaching, parenting, studying or counselling he loves to go camping and mountain
  bike riding or to simply play cricket in the backyard with the boys and enjoy coffee
  with his wife.
