:short_biography: |-
  Colin Stoodley’s life work has revolved around the leadership of Churches in Australia. His background is Salvation Army and Baptist but his heart has always been for the wider Church. His commitment to learning is very strong and alongside a busy ministry life he has always studied – seeking to prepare himself more and more effectively for the work he is doing.
  Colin’s interest lies in practical theology – that is, theology that makes sense, which fits the evidence and leads people to a deeper knowledge of God and of His Son Jesus Christ. He’s also been a Church planter – he is not presently involved in one but has over the past ten years, been a Church planter, trained Church planters and coached them as well. His Master’s thesis concerned the Training, Coaching and Formation for Church planters. As a PhD candidate he is researching the first five years of life among new churches planted in Queensland between 1986-2015.
