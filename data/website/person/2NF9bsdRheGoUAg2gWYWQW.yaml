:full_biography: Greig has a passion to see the church intimately connecting through
  vibrant relationships of local pastors and to see the unified church pastor the
  city together to see the city flourish in the Kingdom of God. He believes the church
  has the message of life and healing that our communities so desperately need and
  therefore has a critical role to play in the life of every city and town. Greig
  also has a passion to see new modes of church birthed that give greater access to
  faith pathways and Jesus community for people who have rejected, or are not open
  to explore, the Sunday Gathered church model.
