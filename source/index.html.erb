<h1>
  megwilliscreative netlify is not working. 
</h1>
<ol>
  <li> create new github account </li>
  <li> create new middleman site </li>
  <li> create new netlify site </li>
<li>  netlify pulled the site from github mwc-mda account, <br> can that same Netlify account pull the old site?
<br>
can that same test site be pulled by the megwilliscreative git, and the megwilliscreative netlify?</li>
<li>I think the project folder is now cloned to mwc github, now I need to update the project and check mwc repo's online, and connect mwc netlify</li>
